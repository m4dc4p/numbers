Numbers
=======

A server for reading 9-digit numbers from network clients. Makes the following assumptions:

  * Valid input is a 9 digits followed by a newline (0x10). (Sorry
    Windows). Invalid input causes the client connection to be dropped
    immediately.
  * If any client writes `terminate` on an empty line, the server quits
    immediately.

Assumptions made:

  * Digits are encoded using ASCII/UTF-8.
  * Clients will generally be well-behaved and long-lived. 
  * The input given will range over the entire range of 1B numbers.

Building
========

Use maven to build and test the project:

  mvn install

Note that commands below are given relative to the root of the source
directory, assuming the jar resides in the `target` directory.

Running the Server
==================

`mvn install` produces an executable jar. To run the server, using java 7:

  java -jar target/numbers-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar

Clients
=======

Several types of clients can also be run:

  * "steady" client - Sends random numbers at a pre-defined rate (specified in
    units of 1,000 requests / sec)
  * "bad" client - Sends bad input some percentage of the time. Immediately
    reconnects when disconnected from the server.
  * "repeat" client - Sends the same number (randomly chosen) over and over.
  * default client - Sends random numbers as fast as possible.

To run the client program, put the `numbers` jar on the class path and execute
`com.codeslower.numbers.client.Main`:

  java -cp target/numbers-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar com.codeslower.numbers.client.Main 

Passing `--help` will give usage information. The server must be running on the
localhost (at port 4000) for clients to connect.
